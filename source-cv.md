## About me
I help teams build secure software without slowing them down. As an Application Security Specialist, I focus on practical, people-first security—from secure SDLC and cloud infrastructure to AI security and compliance. I believe communication and education are key: security should be something people understand and believe in, not something forced on them.

I like good coffee, learning by doing, and trying new things—whether that’s crafting new things in a local shared workshop or with my 3D printer, coding personal projects or spending time in nature. I aim to bring that same curiosity and hands-on mindset into my work every day.
